description="Glue gives destructable environments the realism they need for a good experience.  Procedurally generates a glue network between adjacent collision shapes which optimises collisions and gives realistic breakage, snapping, and stress support behaviours. Additionally a 3D voronoi feature can build a fracture of a 3D asset in engine."
